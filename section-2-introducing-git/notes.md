## What Exactly Is Git?
- Git - the world's most popular version control system 
- Version control - version control is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time 
  - Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more 
- Git is just one VCS 
  - Git is just one of the many version control systems available today. Other well-known ones include Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial 
  - They all have similar goals, but vary significantly in how they achieve those goals. Fortunately, we only need to care about Git because 
- Git is the clear "winner"
  - In stack Overflow's 2018 Developer Survey,nearly 90% of all developers use it 

## Visualizing Git
- Git helps us: 
  - Track changes across multiple files 
  - Compare versions of a project 
  - "Time travel" back to old versions 
  - Revert to a previous version 
  - Collaborate and share changes 
  - Combine changes 
- Think of it as a video game checkpoints, so if you lose a battle you go back to that save point 
  - Other example: tracking versions of an essay 
- See class slides diagram for real life project visualization 

## A Quick History Of Git
- Linus Torvalds 
  - The creator and main developer behind Linux and Git 
  - He was working on Bitkeeper and they removed the free version and Linus was frustrated and wanted a free version control system -- he wanted something fast and open source 
- The Birth of Git 
  - Torvalds wanted a version control system that was super fast and free 
  - Built in April 2005 with the most basic functionality 
  - First official Git release came a couple motnhs later 
- Behind the Name 
  - Torvalds referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it 
  - The official Git source code explains a couple different meanings for the name, depending on your mood 

## Who Uses Git?
- Engineers and coders 
  - From massive tech giants like facebook and google to the tiniest of startups, developers across the globe, use Git 
- Stackshare will show you what stacks companies use 
- Tech-Adjacent Roles 
  - Many people in non-developer roles 
- Governments 
  - Manage the drafting of laws 
  - Washington DC City government uses Git and Github 
  - government.github.com -- shows the different governments that use Git 
- Scientists 
  - Manage code, data sets and more 
  - Git and Github is especially powerful in the peer-reviewed world of science and research 
- Writers 
  - Use git to manage drafts of complex novels, screenplays and other works 
- Anyone really 
  - People find very creative uses for Git ranging from keeping to daily journal to symphony composers 

## Git vs. Github: What's the Difference?
- Git 
  - Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github 
- Github 
  - Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do not need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.
